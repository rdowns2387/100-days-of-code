# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded the structure of the 2017 Meals Resolution app.

**Thoughts:** Structure came together okay, but still figuring out my logic. Tried out a few things with JavaScript, but didn't get too far. Don't want to burn out, so will tackle that tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much going on today. Switched to jQuery when plain JavaScript was stumping. Much easier flow now, but spent the hour today banging my head against the wall.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out some styling... But want to get it completely functional first.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got through the logic of the app. Starting working on LocalStorage to track the number of meals eaten, but I'm not very familiar with localStorage and haven't gotten it to work quite yet... But that's what tomorrow's for!

**Thoughts:** Practice makes perfect. I've used pretty much all of the things I've used in this project in real work projects, but I'm so rusty it's crazy!
