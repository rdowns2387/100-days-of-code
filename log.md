# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded the structure of the 2017 Meals Resolution app.

**Thoughts:** Structure came together okay, but still figuring out my logic. Tried out a few things with JavaScript, but didn't get too far. Don't want to burn out, so will tackle that tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much going on today. Switched to jQuery when plain JavaScript was stumping. Much easier flow now, but spent the hour today banging my head against the wall.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out some styling... But want to get it completely functional first.
